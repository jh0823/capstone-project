When we create the city class in cities.swift  are we supposed to have city_image variable as a String or NSData? I currently have it as String with the filename ex tempe.png as the city_image.,Declare an array in city class to store all section titles. Create a dictionary with section title as key and city object as value in view controller in order to save cities as sections.  (Check fruits table with sections example posted by professor)  Using camera or photo library to add image the image should be stored as NSData type. As cities are stored in array while adding city€™s image or editing city€™s image try to find the index of the city and then add the image to that city object. While adding a city object the index will always be the last index. Do not forget to create outlets from data source and delegate of table view to view controller. Do not forget to add identifier to table view cell.   ,27330,FALL 2019

How are we supposed to calculate the overall rating or the 'Am i at risk?' button if there is only one game?,I used the same criteria to compare the first game with itself.  In such a situation the difference in points will always be zero but the total severity rating of the sole game can be used by itself.  I decided that this was better than leaving it blank as a single game with gt =  10 symptoms should still make someone see risk as unsure (Yellow) and gt = 15 should still alert someone that they are at Very different levels of risk (Red). Ultimately whether the app even shows those screens with only one game entered seems like an unspecified design choice so I made the choice myself.,27330,FALL 2019
